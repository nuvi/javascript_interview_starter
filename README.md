# javascript_interview_starter

Hey guys, this is Sam Keller from the group interview on Thursday.  I am applying for the javascript developer position.

This is a node app using the express framework.

Instruction:

1.  cd to root directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary node_modules.
2.  cd to the public directory and run `bower install bootstrap`, `bower install angular`, `bower install flip`.  Jquery should be included with bootstrap.. if not install it with bower.
3.  cd back to the root directory and run `node app.js`
4.  open up either firefox, chrome, or safari and browse to localhost:3232
5.  look around, find my contact info, and hire me :)
